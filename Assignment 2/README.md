# Facial Recognition using One-shot Learning



Facial Recognition using One-shot Learning. In this assignment, we performed a one-shot learning task for previously unseen objects. We 
used the architecture described in the paper [Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf). The goal: Given two facial images of previously unseen persons, determine whether they are the same person.
